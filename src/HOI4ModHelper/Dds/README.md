Dds files are horrible and need a specific encoding.

"Use DDS format for images. Most of the files are saved in 8.8.8.8 ARGB, 32 bit unsigned sub-format. Some files (like leader portraits) are saved using 1.5.5.5 ARGB 16 bit unsigned variant. Event Image can also be of the .tga format" - https://www.reddit.com/r/hoi4/comments/668kgy/national_spirit_custom_image_having_trouble_with/
